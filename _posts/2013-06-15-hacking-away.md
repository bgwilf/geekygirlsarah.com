This post was originally from the blog site Binary Girls that my friends Abbey, Sarah, and I started. Iâ€™m saving it here for archival reasons.

Abbey, Sarah, Lu, Anthony, and I are hacking away at Hack the Midwest. It&#8217;s our second year, and we have a MUCH larger game in the works. There is lots of progress, but at only 10.5 hours out of 24 hours down, we still have a ways to go on our game.

I&#8217;m tweeting periodically, and the Twitter hashtag for the event is #hackMW if you wish to follow along!
