# Life

Finally determined that my computer was just too sluggish for all the powerful things I keep trying to make it do. I forgot when I bought it, but the more I thought on it, I realized I built Neptune in 2009. And it was already maxed out on upgrades. And I need to keep pushing it with some of the stuff I&#8217;m doing on it lately, so I bought new parts. I name my computers after planets (and when I ran out, other solar system planet-like things), and liked the name of Salacia, so that became my new computer.

One of my encrypted drives got it&#8217;s partition table wiped, and some of the master file table, and just play Yakkity Sax and that&#8217;s what recovering this drive felt like. _**Days**_ later, I managed to get most of the data off of it. I&#8217;m still recovering some more, but it&#8217;s inspired me to maybe write out a &#8220;proper&#8221; way to encrypt (and later recover) your data.

# Work

Reviewed lots of PRs, fixed and pushed out a bug fix, and started learning about the new project I&#8217;ve been added to.

# Entertainment

  * Finished off the 80s and 90s of the Bond Movies. Got stuck on the 2000s because anything after the Pierce Brosnan movies aren&#8217;t on Hulu. Trying to track down the last few because&#8230; I mean&#8230; I&#8217;ve already gotten this far, I might as well finish off the series. Though the last few have been over the top fake and ridiculous. I hope they get better.
  * I started watching BBC&#8217;s Sherlock at one point and stopped, but forgotten most of what happened. I restarted it from season 1 and got through season 3 episode 1. So I&#8217;ll finish off the last two episodes this week.

# Published

  * [Last Week](https://geekygirlsarah.com/2017/01/16/last-week-2017-01-16/) (1/16/2017)
  * Started another post, but delays from recovering encrypted data threw off my week.

# Talks

  * [Tiffany Kuchta &#8211; &#8220;HTTPS Everywhere&#8221;](http://wordpress.tv/2016/11/14/tiffany-kuchta-https-everywhere/): She talks about why she believes every site should run HTTPS now, and some steps to get it onto your server and working with WordPress (if you run it).
  * Maciej Ceg≈Çowski &#8211; &#8220;Superintelligence&#8221; ([text version](http://idlewords.com/talks/superintelligence.htm)/[video version](https://2016.webcampzg.org/talks/view/superintelligence-the-idea-that-eats-smart-people/)): This was great. There&#8217;s all this hype about &#8220;AI is going to take over and kill all the humans!&#8221; and he discusses why this is NOT going to happen. And he makes some great points despite what Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and others say.

# On the Internet

  * I learned that you can [make music with Tesla coils](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee5evlN8Bbs). THEN (because I&#8217;m a nerd), I looked up [_how_ you make music with Tesla coils](http://stevehv.4hv.org/MusicalSSTCs.htm).
  * If you like Mark Hamill, and like him making impressions of The Joker reciting Trump quotes, you will probably find [his audio recordings](https://audioboom.com/HamillHimself) pretty brilliant.
  * [Venus&#8217;s Atmosphere had a bulge in it,](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2017/01/16/venus-atmosphere-bow-wave/) and scientists figured out it was because of gravity waves. (If you like space like I do, read this!)
  * Want to watch grown adults build elaborate cardboard things, then run around and destroy them? [Boxwars](https://www.youtube.com/user/BoxwarsCouncil) is for you then.
  * [Quantum vibrations happen inside our brain](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140116085105.htm). This is too dense for me to read fully but it sort of blew my mind (though I have no clue if it was blown in a quantum way or not).
  * Rachel Ralston wrote about [her attempts at writing out algorithms, and why they didn&#8217;t work](https://medium.com/@rachel_ftw/trusting-yourself-in-solving-algorithms-9dd697e4069f), and turns out the problem wasn&#8217;t in the algorithm, but yet, it&#8217;s easy to doubt your own capabilities. She has some great advice for looking at situations like this and trusting yourself more.
  * Finally, Packt Publishing has been offering [one free technology book per day](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning), but stopped for December and part of January. They&#8217;re back at it again, so go start grabbing free ebooks!
