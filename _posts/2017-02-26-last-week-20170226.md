  Life
</h1>

Life&#8217;s been a mess. I&#8217;ve decided to skip two week&#8217;s of &#8220;Last Week&#8221; posts because, well, I just plain forgot to do them. And navigating through browser histories is a mess.

I&#8217;m working on moving to a new apartment, as well as getting over food poisoning, as well as trying to find time to actually work on the secret project (it&#8217;s been about 3 weeks untouched). So I&#8217;m pretty drained. Moving shortly isn&#8217;t going to help with the energy issue. But the ultimate pay off should be getting somewhat out of a rut, getting rid of some anxiety, and just generally feeling calmer. So we&#8217;ll see.

# Work

Started one feature ticket, almost completed before end of sprint. It carried over as there&#8217;s a small part to finish on it. I also implemented a documentation generator for our PHP/Symfony code, and that will soon run on our nightly builds along with an existing JS documentation generator.

# Entertainment

  * Watched Smokey and the Bandit 1 and 2. I saw them referenced in one of those &#8220;Underrated Films You Should See&#8221; lists, so decided to watch.  (Honestly, I watched the third too but it was _**baaaaaaaad**_&#8230;)

# On the Internet

  * [Space] [NASA discovers 7 Earth-sized planets](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-telescope-reveals-largest-batch-of-earth-size-habitable-zone-planets-around) orbitting a &#8220;nearby&#8221; star.  (Where &#8220;nearby&#8221; is about 40 lightyears.) It&#8217;s interesting because all 7 are located close enough to that sun to be in that &#8220;might possibly have life&#8221; area.
  * [Development] [Evolution of a Python Programmer](https://gist.github.com/fmeyer/289467) is a funny read on how you can take one simple function and how it can be drastically rewritten depending on whether you&#8217;re a beginner or an expert programmer.
  * [Development] If you love geeky, in-depth bug diagnostics stories, [the Cloudflare memory leak incident of last week](https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/) is interesting, but the details of tracking it down and how it was just a tiny simple code fix are fascinating.
  * [STEM, Cute] &#8220;[Watch: 7-year-old Noelle explain how this new gadget she created works.](https://www.facebook.com/becauseofthemwecan/videos/1265100506873165/)&#8221; is about as adorable as you can imagine. And I love her explaining it too. So many great future engineers out there!
  * [Cute] [10+ Animals That Look Like They’re About To Drop The Hottest Albums Of The Year](http://www.boredpanda.com/animals-about-to-drop-album-photos/). Because we all need stuff like this in our lives, right?
  * [Cute] [Keeping Up with the Kattarshians](http://nutiminn.is/kattarshians/) is a super adorable live stream of some cats and what happens in their household. (which, honestly, is mostly sleeping)
  * [Engineering] [A Pennsylvania Town Came Up With A Low-Tech Solution To Keep Cars From Killing People](https://www.fastcoexist.com/3068268/a-pennsylvania-town-came-up-with-a-low-tech-solution-to-keep-cars-from-killing-people). it almost seems ridiculously simple, but putting a container of flags at stoplights, and grabbing one and holding it as you cross the street has made cars more aware there&#8217;s people there. And fewer accidents have occurred. So low-tech, and so smart.
  * [Nerding] I learned that some British researchers came up with a formula for [how high your shoe&#8217;s heels should be](http://www.madeforwalking.org/optimum-heel-height-h-q123s8/) given a particular situation. The formula ( h = Q\*(12+3s/8) where Q = P\*(9+y)\*L /(t+1)\*(a+1)\*(y+10)\*(L+£20) ) is definitely not a simple one. I sort of love how they turned something fashion-related into a math/science thing.
