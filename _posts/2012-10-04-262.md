_This post was originally from the blog site Binary Girls that my friends Abbey, Sarah, and I started. I&#8217;m saving it here for archival reasons._

Hello! I&#8217;m Sarah, one of the two Sarahs on this site. I&#8217;m a student at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. I met Abbey and Sarah at the Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas Women in Computing conference last year. Since having some rather good conversations with both of them at that conference, we kept in contact afterward. This past summer we decided to join together and start a rather geeky blog together.

The next several posts from all of us will be from Baltimore. We are at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing conference. They both have been here before but it&#8217;s my first time. I&#8217;ve only been here for about an hour and it&#8217;s still a bit of crazy experience. There are so many geeks, but not just that. \*Women\* geeks!

I&#8217;m going to start updating regularly both at this conference and back at home.

Have a wonderful day!
