_This post was originally from the blog site Binary Girls that my friends Abbey, Sarah, and I started. Iâ€™m saving it here for archival reasons._

I ended my spring semester with a A in Assembly Language, A- in Operating Systems, A- in Special Topics: Java, and a C+ in calculus 2 (which is probably not bad considering the class is a bit evil). I still have my great GPA, which definitely makes me happy!

Today I started my first day of my internship at Perceptive Software. While today was mostly orientations, paperwork, ID pictures, and making user accounts, I am looking forward to tomorrow, where I will meet my first team and find out what I&#8217;ll be doing this summer.

Since I won&#8217;t be swamped with school, I&#8217;m hoping to keep blogging. My goal was one per week, and I&#8217;m hoping to get back to that goal this summer.
