_This post was originally from the blog site Binary Girls that my friends Abbey, Sarah, and I started. Iâ€™m saving it here for archival reasons._

  * We had turkey made in the oven with a wireless digital thermometer, just like the pilgrims did.
  * We made green beans in a ZipLock veggie steamer bag, just like the pilgrims did.
  * We made mashed potatoes with help from an [<u><span style="color: #0066cc;">article on LifeHacker</span></u>](http://lifehacker.com/5961541/save-time-by-peeling-a-potato-with-your-bare-hands) talking about how to peel potatoes, just like the pilgrims did.
  * We had some Diet Dr Pepper, just like the pilgrims did.
  * We ate some blueberry pie fresh from the store, just like the pilgrims did.
  * We sat down with our computers and shopped, blogged, and texted, just like the pilgrims did.

All in all, a pretty authentic Thanksgiving, if you ask me.
