  Life
</h1>

I was supposed to teach a Girl Develop It class but it got cancelled.

The National Center for Women in Information Technology (NCWIT) has a regional MO/KS chapter, and we held our annual awards for aspirations in computing ceremony. I helped with some of the planning for it. We got to give out 30 awards to high school girls. It&#8217;s always great to hear about the ambitions these young women have, and I only hope they can keep doing great work out in the tech world!

And I&#8217;m about to catsit for a few days, which always makes me happy since I don&#8217;t get as many cat cuddles since my cat died.

# Work

We have a part of our system that&#8217;s complicated and everyone hates. One of my coworkers used part of the Symfony (PHP) framework to build a generator to make it easier. I found a bug in it, and fixed it. Also did one new feature ticket and started a second.

# Entertainment

  * Caught up with more of The Daily Show and @midnight
  * [SNL was brilliant, and the NYT wrote about it](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/arts/television/trump-snl-melissa-mccarthy-sean-spicer.html) 

# Published

  * [Last Week](https://geekygirlsarah.com/2017/01/23/last-week-2017-01-23/) (1/30/2017)

# Talks

None this week.

# On the Internet

  * I feel like I need a separate &#8220;Cool Stuff in Space and Science!&#8221; section. First, a thought piece on [if there are aliens, why they likely won&#8217;t think the same as we do](http://io9.gizmodo.com/why-aliens-might-understand-the-universe-very-different-756672023). Or possibly even perceive us at all.
  * Then, [why small animals and insects perceive the world in slow motion](http://io9.gizmodo.com/small-animals-perceive-the-world-in-slow-motion-1325576746#_ga=1.20298360.1716529563.1486420584) while we perceive it much faster.
  * And take a look at [how cats perceive the world](http://io9.gizmodo.com/these-images-show-just-how-differently-cats-and-humans-1445728239). Rather interesting!
  * A friend and I were talking about styles, and she described hers as &#8220;Toddler Grandma Style&#8221;. I asked her about it and [she sent me this](https://theestablishment.co/toddler-grandma-style-the-fashion-approach-that-will-set-you-free-92f787202928). Basically women are expected to have certain standards except toddlers and grandmothers, so her style incorporates these into it because she doesn&#8217;t care what people think.
  * On a familiar thought but the other side of it, [someone who works for the Obamacare phone line talk about what it&#8217;s like to work there](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-operator-calls_us_588fd0d9e4b02772c4e8c758?), and how they get lots of very deep and sad questions, and they can&#8217;t really answer them. They talk about the experiences and what they do to answer them.
  * [Nate Taylor](https://twitter.com/taylonr) wrote a wonderful post called [&#8220;Thank You&#8221;](http://taylonr.com/thank-you/). He thanks many people that helped him get the career spot that he&#8217;s at now. It&#8217;s also a great look at how there are many people that help you get there,Â  whether just a small conversation once to people who have worked with you nearly daily to get you there.
  * A conversation at work made this video of the many times [Riker (Star Trek) sits down in a chair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVIGhYMwRgs) by lifting his leg over the back of the chair instead of just sitting like most people. It also led to this article on [&#8220;The Ubiquitous Roving Plants of the Starship Enterprise.&#8221;](http://the-toast.net/2015/04/16/roving-plants-of-the-starship-enterprise/) And I&#8217;ll admit&#8230; I never noticed just how many houseplants there were on this starship. Maybe a bulk discount sale from Costco?
  * If you didn&#8217;t [catch the news from GitLab](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/02/01/gitlab_data_loss/) in the past week, they experienced some data loss. They had 5 different kinds of backups going, and **all** 5 failed. (They had local, off-site, and cloud backups.) As I also experienced some backup issues recently, I&#8217;m wanting to write a guide for proper backing up and encrypting of data. See it as a blog post soon!
  * A friend was talking about how she is using Trello on her job hunt, and [linked this post](http://blog.trello.com/using-trello-for-a-job-search-less-stress-more-process). It&#8217;s a really good idea, and started using a similar pattern to apply to conferences. (It&#8217;s basically the same idea, right?)
