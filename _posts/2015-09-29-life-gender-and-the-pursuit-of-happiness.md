  I was probably in first grade when I wrote my first computer program. My parents had a Commodore 64. (I<span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="8ee8c8a1fc43">f you’re a bit younger, it was about equivalent in power to the original Nintendo </span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="8ee8c8a1fc43">game</span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="8ee8c8a1fc43"> system.</span>) My dad taught me how to put in a floppy disk, flip the lever to lock it in, then type <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">LOAD “*”,8,1</strong>. I had no clue what that meant, but the computer listened. I eventually learned there were a lot of other commands you could enter to do a variety of other things, and the computer listened to all of them. It fascinated me. I copied programs in from the instruction manual, then would change them, or add on to them, to make the computer do more things.

  I was teased in elementary school for being a nerd. I was teased in middle school for it too, but also for having no athletic skills. By high school the teasing subsided, and people actually saw that I really was getting good at computer programming. Through this and some other after school activities, I started establishing a name for myself as a technical person.

  I was always pretty smart. I did well in my classes. As in the ones I enjoyed, Bs in the ones not as much. I graduated from high school in the top 8% of my class of 340 people. I spent practically all of the free time my parents would allow writing programs and learning more about computers. I felt as if I was capable of doing anything I put my mind to.

  I started at a community college my first year after high school, and after that moved to a school that was in state but far away. I needed to move away from home for a while. I was majoring in computer science (the obvious choice) and was doing very well. For a while anyway.

  There was a problem. <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="2b99992a2d61">For as long as I could remember, this problem plagued my mind in some fashion or another. Depression. </span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="2b99992a2d61 d001463831ff f2b76a4e6e74 c8075c0b741 fedf1a525e2a anon">This feeling of life being awful. The feeling that I was awful.</span> I hated it. The more time went on though, the more the depression soaked into my life. It stems back as far as I can remember — all the way back to kindergarten. I had many times in high school where I hated my life and really couldn’t stand it. It got worse in college. By the fifth semester, depression was so bad that I didn’t have the energy to go to class, and learning was impossible. My brain had basically shut off by that point. I couldn’t think straight. <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="eecfd5470c4b a8d254c43775">I was chronically unmotivated to do anything, often including eating.</span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="a8d254c43775"> Those computer projects I loved hadn’t been touched in years. My passions were gone, and basically any form of existence I had known was gone too.</span> I really wanted to die. I finally dropped out of college to try to save my falling 1.9 GPA before it got worse.
