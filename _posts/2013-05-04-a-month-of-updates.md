This post was originally from the blog site Binary Girls that my friends Abbey, Sarah, and I started. Iâ€™m saving it here for archival reasons.

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-305" src="/assets/images/sarahwprofile.jpg" alt="Sarah's picture" width="175" height="175" /> It&#8217;s been a crazy busy semester. In the last month&#8230;

  * I was elected president of Upsilon Pi Epsilon, the international computer science honor society.
  * I traveled to Denver, CO for the IEEE Region 5 conference as the school robotics team was competing there. (Good news: we tied for fifth place.)
  * The school&#8217;s ACM programming teams entered a programming competition. We at least had a team in the top third.
  * I&#8217;ve been doing homework non-stop for the past few weeks.
  * I had student evaluations this past week. It&#8217;s always a little weird having them grade me, but I do look forward to hearing what they like/don&#8217;t like about the course (and me) and possible improvements.
  * I was selected by the Computer Science/Electrical Engineering (CSEE) department faculty to receive the Outstanding Junior in the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science award at UMKC.
  * I received not one, but two scholarships from the department for next school year.
  * I have received an internship from Perceptive Software to be a software engineer for their Research and Development department.

Lots of great stuff!

This upcoming week is also my last week of classes, and the week after that is finals. I&#8217;ll have a couple of weeks off (much needed, I&#8217;ll add) and then I&#8217;ll start my internship. It should be a great summer!

Unfortunately it&#8217;s been so busy I don&#8217;t have much time to sit down and write, but I did at least want to post all the great stuff going on lately. I&#8217;ll probably be able to write more after finals.

_Do you have any exciting summer plans?_
