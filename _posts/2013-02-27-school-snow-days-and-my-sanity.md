This post was originally from the blog site Binary Girls that my friends Abbey, Sarah, and I started. Iâ€™m saving it here for archival reasons.

Before I started back to school to finish my degree, this little voice in my head said &#8220;Are you insane? You want to go back to homework? You want to go back to tests? You&#8217;re crazy!&#8221;<!--more-->

Then I started school. And it was going well. And I was glad I did it.

Then the past few days were crazy winter storms in Kansas City. Twice we&#8217;ve had storms produce 10+ inches of snow. School has been cancelled twice now. Which has been nice, since I had relaxing, calm days at home.

Then it soaks in tonight: &#8220;Oh crap&#8230; I have one test tonight at 5:30, one test tomorrow at 11:00, and one test tomorrow at 2:00. And I haven&#8217;t studied for any of them!&#8221;

And that voice comes back, asking &#8220;Are you insane?&#8221;

Yes, I am definitely insane. But I want my computer science degree, gosh darn it!
