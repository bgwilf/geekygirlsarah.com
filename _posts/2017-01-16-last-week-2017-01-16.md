# Life

  * I did beta test #4 of my &#8220;secret project&#8221; on Monday. I think after I wrap up some final details, I&#8217;m about ready to start pushing it to prod!
  * On Tuesday, I went to a &#8220;Girls Night Out&#8221; meetup event at a trivia night at a restaurant. It was a lot of fun and got to chat with several cool women in town.
  * On Wednesday I had dinner with Rachel, someone I randomly meet at an event in town after she tweeted that she needed a phone battery charger and included the event hashtag, and I happened to see it and loaned it to her. Then decided last week &#8220;why don&#8217;t we actually talk?&#8221; And we were chatting up a storm before we realized we both needed to head home. I need to get together with her again, she&#8217;s fun!
  * I&#8217;ve been feeling the sluggishness of my desktop computer for a while. After some conversations with some people, I realized that I built it in 2009, and just threw more upgrades at it. But it&#8217;s maxed out&#8230; I really can&#8217;t do anything else to it. So with the help of my friend Lindsey, I bought a new computer, and built it! It&#8217;s the first computer I had to get my own heatsink for, so after the first didn&#8217;t work out, I got a second one. And the computer is up and running! I name my computers after planets, and ran out after Neptune and Pluto, so I had to move on to other &#8220;gravitationally round&#8221; objects in the solar system. So Neptune is retiring and [Salacia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/120347_Salacia) is now the main machine. And it&#8217;s a beast, but lately have been doing a lot of number crunching, along with other background software, so this should help out _immensely_!

# Work

  * Up to this point in my job, I&#8217;ve been solving bugs or adding new features in random modules of our software we develop. It&#8217;s been hard to ramp up here because I feel like I&#8217;ve been all over the place when trying to learn things. This past week I was assigned onto a new project to rewrite an older module into our newer framework. I&#8217;m actually really excited because it means I can hopefully figure out this module and not have to keep feeling like I&#8217;m relearning things
  * I reviewed multiple PRs.
  * I solved 3 bugs.
  * One bug carried over into the next sprint.
  * I had Monday off for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day!

# Entertainment

  * Finished Die Hard 4 and 5 (I started 1-3 the previous week). I feel like DH 5 should be called &#8220;Die Hard and Let&#8217;s See How Many Cars We Can Destroy While We&#8217;re At It&#8221;
  * Listened to a few episodes of [Women in Tech podcast](http://podcast.womenintechshow.com/episodes).
  * I&#8217;ve also been watching James Bond movies. They&#8217;re a good part of &#8220;oh that&#8217;s cool!&#8221; and &#8220;oh dear, not good towards women,&#8221; though as I seem to be getting later in the decades, they are definitely getting better (though still not perfect). I would love to have some of those gadgets though.

# Talks

  * Nothing this week

# On the Internet

  * The most hilarious thing I&#8217;ve seen in a while is [this horse playing with a rubber chicken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTde65Mi98). I could probably watch this for an hour because it&#8217;s that hilarious!
  * Apparently Google discreetly [changed Google Translate from a phrase-based translation service to a neural network one](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-mind-blowing-ai-announcement-from-google-that-you-probably-missed-2ffd31334805). And somehow in the process, that neural net invented its own intermediary language. Fascinating! (And reminds me I need to start that machine learning/neural net online class I saw a long time ago because it&#8217;s something I want to learn.)
  * I have a big interest in AI and machine learning, but really haven&#8217;t spent any time trying to dig in yet. Though interestingly, [this article about writing your first artificial intelligence](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-write-your-very-first-powerful-artificial-intelligence-s-440895442c03) makes sense. You got to start simple and work up from there!
  * This [laundry folding machine](http://www.businessinsider.com/laundry-folding-robot-foldimate-video-2016-12) is pretty cool!
  * This article proposes that [there&#8217;s an age group for IKEA furniture](https://www.fastcoexist.com/3066816/if-you-havent-already-you-will-one-day-outgrow-ikea-furniture), and you might have &#8220;outgrown&#8221; it already.
