This post was originally from the blog site Binary Girls that my friends Abbey, Sarah, and I started. I’m saving it here for archival reasons.

So I survived another semester of school. I received an A in discrete structures 2 and a B- in physics 1. I wanted better but it was a bit of a rough semester. I&#8217;ll take it though!  My GPA is still over 3.6, which is pretty nice! It&#8217;s the highest GPA of my life.

Since the semester is over, I&#8217;m hoping to write more. I have a list of posts I would like to write.

Have you had a good semester?
