So the first week of the spring semester is over. I feel good about this semester, which is great since my last one was so emotional and tiring. But I want to talk about the cool things about it so far!<!--more-->

First, I&#8217;m taking four classes, which is 13 hours. Three of them are programming classes. It&#8217;s really great that I have so many gen. ed&#8217;s out of the way so that I can mostly focus on computer science. It&#8217;s a weird mix though, between x86 assembly language, Java, and operating systems, it&#8217;s definitely three totally different directions of programming. But at the same time, it should be super fun!

Second, I already have bits of knowledge of all three, but it will be great to supplement my knowledge with new things. I already know so much about operating systems, but I&#8217;ll get to learn more and develop code that actually works with processes and threads and all that good stuff. I also took Java before, but it was around the days of Java 2. Now that Java 7 is out, I&#8217;m out of date. I had one class and already learned new things! I also took an assembly language class but need to take it again. That was a MIPS-based class, and this one is an x86-based one, so it&#8217;s the same ideas, but probably even more useful since I pretty much work with x86 types of computers anyway.

Third, I&#8217;m teaching a third section of my labs this semester. It&#8217;s more work, but then again I get paid more. The great thing is it&#8217;s an extra class, but I really don&#8217;t have to do extra preparation since it&#8217;s the same material for all three labs. I do have to grade more, so that will be a bit more work, but I am starting to like working with the students and sharing my love for computer science and programming, which I&#8217;ve been told by a few people that it really comes out in the way I teach. Anyway, I&#8217;ve also been told we get a new computer lab to teach in (I don&#8217;t have to kick out other students in the open lab) and that should be really nice as well.

Finally, my transfer credits have really messed up my schedules. I have no gen eds, so I have to pretty much follow a strict layout of how I take classes to meet prerequisites. Also several classes didn&#8217;t transfer in credit for one reason or another, so while I came in with nearly 90 hours to my name already, I had to retake a lot of things. This is the first semester where I&#8217;m taking new classes that I&#8217;ve never taken before, and they are 400-level classes. It feels _wonderful_ to finally see the light at the end of the tunnel, to finally feel like graduation will be in the near future and not in 2032 (like I jokingly tell people I will graduate in). I still am taking calc 2 (which I should have been done with by now) and assembly language (my last 200-level class), but it&#8217;s still nice because it&#8217;s so much programming and so much new material!

My semester will have its own challenges (teaching more, lots of programming, and everything about calc 2), but after this first week I almost feel more refreshed. I have great teachers that are nice, fun, and easy to understand, the class material seems doable (at least, the computer science ones do), and I get to learn great new things in computer science. I&#8217;m definitely ready to face this semester.

What was one of your favorite semesters in college? What made it so great?
