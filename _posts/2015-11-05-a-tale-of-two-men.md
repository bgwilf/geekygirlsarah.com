_**One of the men held me back. One of them gave me an opportunity to shine.**_

This is a post I originally wrote on Medium.

  It was 2011, and I went back to university to finish my degree. There was a new student orientation I went to that had a student organization fair. They had booths for the various organizations around campus. I saw the one for the robotics competition team.
</p>

<p id="84dc" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">
  “What’s going to be your major?” asked the person at the booth.
</p>

<p id="e362" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">
  “Computer science.”
</p>

<p id="9e0e" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">
  “REALLY? We really need more computer science people!”
</p>

  So I signed up. I didn’t know a thing about robots, but it seemed interesting. I had taken two circuits classes at my first university, so I figured I could probably pick up stuff fairly fast.

  I was introduced to Dan*. He was the current software developer there. He had been a part of the team for several years, and single-handedly coded most of the robots for the past few years. I asked him how everything worked and he said he didn’t have time. I asked if I could see the code, and he wouldn’t show it to me. I asked how I could help out and he’d just tell me the robot was already programmed.
</p>

<p id="c69f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
  I went to the advisor. “Dan’s not really working with me.”
</p>

<p id="dbbe" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">
  “Give it time.”
</p>

<p id="6ba6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
  I gave it a month. I sat around each meeting doing nothing and not really being shown anything. I went back to the advisor.
</p>

<p id="aa3a" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">
  “Just stick it out. There will be stuff to do.”
</p>

<p id="80a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
  I “stuck it out” for another month of sitting around doing nothing. I went back to her.
