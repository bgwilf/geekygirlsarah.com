  Life

I forgot to post this last Monday when &#8220;last week&#8221; would have been last week. Oops. Because I&#8217;m going back in history, this may not be terribly full of up-to-date stuff.

I auditioned (again) for the Kansas City Women&#8217;s Chorus. And&#8230;  I got in! And in the past 7 days, I&#8217;ve been to 3 choir rehearsals! But it&#8217;s going back to 1 a week now, which is nicer. But even after just one week, I&#8217;m starting to memorize large parts of songs AND seem to be singing them decently well. I&#8217;m still in a bit of shock that I&#8217;m pulling this off!

# Work

I was put on to a new project at work, and mostly spent this week catching up on how it worked and what the science team does. My coworker and I did get to go to the actual science lab and see their work (and they even let us see what they do in microscopes, and see their work under the vent hoods, centrifuges, cell counting machines, and more).  It felt like I was watching a medical TV show in real life.

# Entertainment

  * Finished off Sherlock (Season 2-3)
  * Started catching back up on The Daily Show. (It&#8217;s my political news but in a MUCH easier to digest form.)

# Published

  * [Last Week](https://geekygirlsarah.com/2017/01/23/last-week-2017-01-23/) (1/23/2017)

# Talks

None this week

# On the Internet

  * An interview with [Rebecca Givens, probably the most famous stock photo model](http://www.topmodeladvice.com/interview-rebecca-givens/). It&#8217;s interesting as she talks about seeing her pictures everywhere and how no one really knows who she is, and how she thinks she became so recognizable.

I looked through browser histories and couldn&#8217;t seem to find much interesting. Probably because I&#8217;m working on this so late. Maybe better luck next week&#8230;
