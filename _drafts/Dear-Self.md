#### A letter from a woman to herself {.graf.graf--h4}

<p class="graf graf--p">
  Dear Sarah,
</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">
  Hi. It’s me, yourself. And this seems like the stupidest letter ever (including the one I wrote to my best friend who died), but I’m going to write it anyway in hopes maybe it’ll be beneficial to both of us. (And it’s perhaps stupid to refer to myself as two people, but I’m going with it for the sake of this letter.)
</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">
  For the longest time, I’ve hated you. I have memories from elementary school wishing you didn’t exist. I’ve cried myself to sleep before because I hated your existence. I beat you up because I hated your body so much. (There’s still scars from some of that.) To be perfectly honest, I don’t know how we made it this far.
