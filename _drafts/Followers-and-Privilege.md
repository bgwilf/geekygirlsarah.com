I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot over the past couple of months about followers. Like Twitter followers, or Instagram followers, or any sort of social media set of followers. But let me back up a bit.

**Background**

I started my Twitter account in July 2012. I literally don&#8217;t remember creating my account. But I do remember how I started: a nobody. Well, maybe not that bad. I followed a few friends, a few &#8220;celebrity geeks&#8221; as I&#8217;ll call them, some stuff to create a feed. But it just didn&#8217;t seem worth it&#8230;  I was getting tweets, but didn&#8217;t see much point to retweeting. And I had my own tweets, but not really anyone who paid attention. I maybe had, at most, a hundred followers for the first several years.

I went to a couple of conferences from 2013-2014. I made a few friends, followed on Twitter. But still&#8230;  didn&#8217;t really have much use for Twitter. It wasn&#8217;t until I started conference speaking in March 2015 when the number started to rise. Very slowly it went over 100. After giving a conference talk that was so popular it elicited an encore (and both presentations were PACKED), it went over 200. And I talked some more. I tweeted something that went &#8220;baby viral&#8221; (it wasn&#8217;t like millions of views, but was viral for my unheard of self). Then jumped on the #ILookLikeAnEngineer tag before it went viral, which meant a ton of people saw my picture. And then I wrote a blog post that got over 8000 views. My followers went up. And it went up. And by the end of 2015, I was nearing 1000 followers. Whoa.

In 2016 I spoke at so many  more conferences. I was using Twitter a TON to tweet to people. Another couple of tweets went more viral. My real life friends started joking about how famous I was because I had 1000+ followers at one point. And this number slowly grew. It hit 1900 by the end of the year.

I hit 2000 followers while I was at Self.Conference this year. And it felt weird. I still feel kind of like I&#8217;m this nobody. Yet, someone told me their college professor in Utah knew of my work. I was quoted by someone at a conference in Oslo. I run into people in town who come up to me and go &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re Sarah, the one who gave [insert talk or workshop], right?&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t call me famous, but people know who I am. They know some of my work. I now seem to have a reputation.

But the thing that made me start thinking a lot was watching after I hit 2000 that it seemed my followers grows faster. More regularly I can tweet something that makes thousands of impressions a day. And&#8230;  what does it mean to be popular on social media?

(For this most, I&#8217;ll pretty much refer to Twitter, but similar thoughts can apply to Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, whatever.)

**&#8220;Twitter Famous&#8221;**

I&#8217;ve followed a variety of people on Twitter. I like to follow smart people. Cool developers. I especially like to follow women in tech and try to amplify their tweets when I can. I follow some funny people too. For the most part though, I don&#8217;t really follow celebrities. I guess I like people I feel I can interact with  more.

Recently, I&#8217;ve noticed a growing number of my friends become Twitter verified. You know, where they get that fancy blue checkmark that verifies that this person is who they claim they are. I have yet to figure out fully how this works. I&#8217;ve seen people with thousands and thousands of followers not get verified. I&#8217;ve seen people with followers less than I do get verified. I thought maybe it was The Big Name Companies, but found some work at companies I&#8217;ve never heard of, and even some Big Name Company employees that aren&#8217;t verified. The best that I can tell is maybe, for some reason, their follower count had to jump really fast, and some Twitter algorithm took notice.

But every so often I check out profiles of people I follow. The verified friends? Their followers are skyrocketing higher even more since being verified. Like Twitter makes you more famous after you&#8217;ve become famous. Someone I know had about the same followers I did, then went up to about 4K. Few months later? 14K. What??? And this seems to be a thing with others too. Blue checkmark == more popularity.

**Side Effects of Fame**

Every so often someone loses their job. The tech world is kind of cruel about it. Startups rise and fall. Massive layoffs happen. And sometimes there&#8217;s other reasons too. And when you&#8217;re laid off as a tech worker, I think the natural place to go is talk about it on Twitter, of course.

I see a lot of &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m looking for a new opportunity. I do [list of things]. Let me know if you find something! RT please!&#8221; type of tweets. And Twitter is a _great_ networking tool, I&#8217;ve definitely used it as such. But here&#8217;s the kicker: it works a lot better if you&#8217;re verified or have a ton of followers.

I&#8217;ve seen people with a couple of hundred followers tweet regularly about needing a job, and nothing comes their way. I&#8217;ve seen people with thousands and interviews are pretty much thrown at them. Someone can get a new job pretty quickly with that fame that social media can bring.

But not just this. If you want to start a Kickstarter or other crowd-funding request, if it&#8217;s advertised by those with a lot of followers, then it could likely meet it&#8217;s goal super fast. Others? Maybe&#8230; maybe not&#8230;

With crowd-funding, it used to be a new idea, or a new product, or a new musical album&#8230; something requiring a lot of money to get started. The end result? You&#8217;d get the thing ahead of others. You could get that album on their first batch. Or get a product earlier than others. Or get to beta test a new game. Whatever it was, it was something pretty tangible. But crowd funding seems to have went the way of &#8220;I need money for something&#8221;&#8230;  I&#8217;ve seen medical bills, I&#8217;ve seen needing to fix a broken car, I&#8217;ve seen help for college&#8230;  things that are people who need to pay for expenses that are hard, but the donors don&#8217;t get a thing out of it in the end. And this feels weird to me too. I definitely want to be helpful to people, financially if I can be. But I can&#8217;t pay every medical bill, or every repair needed, or other things. I definitely have things I&#8217;d love to ask for, but it feels weirdly like begging strangers on the internet for money.

But let&#8217;s say I did need something. I got cancer and my insurance wouldn&#8217;t cover it. (Because let&#8217;s face it, insurance sucks.) And I made a GoFundMe or something to help pay for this. Would my social media followers come to my aid? Would I have enough followers to pull this off? Would the followers I have have enough money to pull this off? And if not&#8230;  am I just screwed?

**Desiring Fame**

Someone I know talks a lot about her followers. When I first met her she was a student just getting started in computer science. She still is, but now talks a lot about her followers and how many she has and worries if she posts something will enough people read it and follow her.

This seems to be another thing of the current generation of people&#8230;  a lot of people want to become YouTube stars. They want to have fashion blogs that they can post pictures and get tons of readers. They want to stream video games and have people watch. And on it&#8217;s own I guess there&#8217;s nothing bad about this. But there seems to be some expectation of becoming famous. Like if you make a video in just the right way, you&#8217;ll start to make it big. If you stream the right video games, you&#8217;ll make it big. If you tweet the best outfits, you&#8217;ll make it big.

This bothers me. I remember the first time I really felt this fame. I was speaking at a conference soon, and someone followed me on Twitter. They were local, and their bio said they were interning at the same place I did. I tweeted at them and chatted for a bit about it. Then just asked &#8220;So&#8230; how&#8217;d you find me? What made you decide to follow me?&#8221; OMG they saw I was speaking on something they were super interested in and OMG it was so exciting and they couldn&#8217;t wait! And this was weird. I wanted to tell them &#8220;hey&#8230; calm down. I&#8217;m nobody special.&#8221; Instead, I just told them to find me after the talk and we can chat for a while. After my talk, sure enough they came up to me. And had this smile like they couldn&#8217;t believe they were in my presence.

I struggle with this idea of social media fame. I struggle as I start to become more noticed in the tech community. I struggle more when I find out people are too nervous to come up and talk to me somewhere (real life or online), and it&#8217;s happened multiple times now. Don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8230; I want to do good work, and I&#8217;d love to be known as someone who cares about people, who cares about the community, who is constantly helping others. And if I get 100K followers from that, then great. But I hate this idea that it&#8217;s just about amassing the most followers possible.

**Followers and Privilege**

All of this thought is starting to make me realize something: Twitter fame (or any social media fame, really) is essentially like any other privilege. There&#8217;s many kinds: race, gender, financial, ableism, sexuality (straight vs. not), gender identity (cisgender vs. transgender), and more. Privilege on it&#8217;s own isn&#8217;t bad, but it&#8217;s all about the awareness of it and what you choose to do with it. The best quote I&#8217;ve heard is &#8220;your privilege is the things you don&#8217;t have to think about on a daily basis.&#8221; If you&#8217;re financially well off, you don&#8217;t have to dwell on where your meals are coming from, whether you should pay the electric or water bill next, or if you can afford repairs to your car. And same for any other trait&#8230;  if you don&#8217;t go your day to day life worrying about if it will affect you that day, then it&#8217;s a privilege.

The best thing to do if you have it is to be aware of it, and help those without it. It shouldn&#8217;t be up to minorities to amply their own voices&#8230; that&#8217;s not how it works. (If it was, their voices wouldn&#8217;t need amplifying.) It&#8217;s up to the privileged to make it known what&#8217;s going on. It&#8217;s up to them to make sure other privileged people give the unprivileged chances to speak and make a difference. It&#8217;s the only way it&#8217;ll work.

If you have a lot of followers, please consider what you can say and do to help those who don&#8217;t have that voice. Retweet insightful things that minorities say. Point out the problems that people are dealing with. Use that fan base for good, in addition to your own tweets.

I don&#8217;t want to be &#8220;Twitter famous&#8221;, or any other social media famous, unless it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m known as a kind, caring, helpful community leader. And if I do become Twitter famous because of it, then I want to put that fame to work doing _even more_ kindness, care, and helpfulness back out into the world.
