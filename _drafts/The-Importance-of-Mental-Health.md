### The Importance of Mental Health {.graf.graf--h3}

#### Perhaps an innocent tweet about taking care of your mind was the perfect example of why we’re not taking care of our minds. {.graf.graf--h4}

<p class="graf graf--p">
  I was having a conversation with other developers in an online community. Someone was stressed and anxious about their job because their boss treats them awful, and they felt they weren’t “a developer.” I begged to differ. The boss continues to be condescending, make them redo their work, and pretty promote awfulness. The others in the community were trying to stress the importance of being in a good place mentally. I ended up saying “There ARE jobs that care about you and your mental health because, well… our jobs are using our mind to solve problems. You HAVE to have that health.” And it felt important enough to tweet:

  Many agreed (via liking it and retweeting it). But some others had some interesting opposition to it.

<p class="graf graf--p">
  So one of the main things I thought about was that if you have a job involving a lot of physical labor, then you beat up your body more. You need to make sure you take care of it. Exercise makes it stronger, massages help relieve tension, and stretching properly warms up or cools down your muscles. There’s not a lot of disputing this. Society seems to emphasize how important things are.

<p class="graf graf--p">
  But what about other jobs? Jobs where you use your mind? As a developer, I’m given a problem and I have to write software to solve it. I don’t move much, but my brain sure runs through a ton of thoughts in order to solve this problem. I’ve noticed though when I’m sleepy, my brain doesn’t work as well. When there’s a lot of stress from friends or family, I tend to think more on that than my work. If I’m given too much to work on, I tend to try to think on all of it at the same time, meaning I basically don’t get anything done.

<p class="graf graf--p">
  Everyone, no matter their profession, really needs to take care of everything. You don’t ever <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">just</em> your body or mind, there’s always bits of both. But mental health is often forgotten, or its importance not mentioned by society, or people tell you that something you’re going through isn’t valid or true.

  I felt the reminder was important. And the bulk of my audience are developers, so I wrote my tweet aimed for developers.
