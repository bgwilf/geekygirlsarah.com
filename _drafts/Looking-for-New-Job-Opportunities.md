Hi! I&#8217;ve started looking for a new job opportunity, and would love to be considered for positions that you have!

  * I have a **<a href="http://linkedin.com/in/sarahwithee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>** profile as well

  * Reach out to me at my **[Contact](https://sarahwithee.com/contact/)** page

### About Me

  * I&#8217;m a polyglot (multi-language-speaking) software engineer with a really wide breadth of experiences.
  * I have loved software development since I was kid, and I love working on technology in and out of my job.
  * I&#8217;ve also become a conference speaker and have spoke at about two dozen different conferences and events.
  * I have a lot of community involvement and am well-known to be a supportive, encouraging, and fun member of many communities.
  * Since 2011, I have taught or mentored over a thousand people from a variety of university classes, programming workshops for women or students, student robotics leagues, and visited many schools to encourage learning STEM-related careers.

### What Am I Looking For?

I&#8217;m looking to be a senior software engineer or a developer advocate at a company with a culture for

For software engineering:

  * I am drawn to interesting projects with challenging parts to them.
  * I love many parts of the development process, from the initial design, through coding, through testing and deployment.
  * I would need a place where my work would be valued and I can contribute to the product and mentor others, but also where there&#8217;s adequate opportunities for me to learn from my coworkers and from the actual tech I would be working with.
  * I want a place where I can do my work, but still have the support to continue my community work and my speaking opportunities

For developer advocacy:

  * I love being able to build great projects and sharing the work involved as well as what I enjoy about it. For me, I see developer advocacy as a developer position but with extra involvement in sharing with different communities.
  * I have loved traveling the past few years, and would look forward to opportunities to do this.
  * I&#8217;m great at connecting with communities, whether that&#8217;s in real life or digitally. I would definitely look forward to an opportunity to do this

Lines of work:

  * I would love to get into more internet of things (IoT) devices and development, and have several years of hardware and robotics experience
  * I I&#8217;m also very interested in machine learning (ML) and would look forward to opportunities in being able to help a team take on this kind of work
  * I love learning all sorts of new things, so I&#8217;m also interesting in a wide-variety of tech and in different fields. I love learning all sorts of new things!

### What About Relocation?

I am _absolutely_ on-board for relocating. The more I have traveled in the past few years, the more excited I get at the idea of living somewhere else for a while. I love Kansas City, but I&#8217;ve basically lived here my whole life, and I feel it&#8217;s time for a change of environment.

### Want to Chat?

Feel free to message me on <a href="https://sarahwithee.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my Contact page</a> or on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/sarahwithee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> with a job description and I&#8217;ll get back with you!
