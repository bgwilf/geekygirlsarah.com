I recently spoke at a Meetup with a talk I&#8217;ve given a bunch of times. Mid-presentation, I noticed about 10 slides missing. By that point, it was too late to do anything about it. So&#8230; what happened?

**Background**

&#8220;<a href="https://sarahwithee.com/speaking/intro-to-hacking-with-the-raspberry-pi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intro to Hacking with the Raspberry Pi</a>&#8221; is my oldest and most popular talk. I&#8217;ve now given it 8 times, and it&#8217;s been pretty successful every time. It&#8217;s designed to help inspire people to take a Raspberry Pi and integrate it into household &#8220;hacking&#8221; projects so they can maybe automate things or just build something fun and silly.

I gave the first version of this talk in 2015, and quickly made a second version that had some better projects. I gave this version a TON that year. I skipped a year, then started giving it again in 2017. I learned a lot about slide design since then, scrapped the old version of my talk and rewrote it from scratch. I trashed one of the sample projects and replaced it with a better one. I redid the wiring diagrams to be clearer. I explained things in simpler terms and with fewer words. And I felt rather proud of my 3.0 version of this talk. It was _great_!

**The Meetup**

My friend Justin, the owner of Pittsburgh Code & Supply, a coworking and community space, wanted me to give a talk and ended up picking this one. I knew it was pretty good and didn&#8217;t think it really needed any changes. A couple of months ago, Raspberry Pi came out with a newer model of their 3B model, the 3B+. I updated the specs slide, and started to review the rest of it to make sure it was fine. I got interrupted, and when I came back forgot to look at the rest of it, but was confident it was fine and I was good to go.

I knew he was going to be recording this, and I have a lack of recordings of my talks online, so I was looking forward to having a nice video of myself online.

While presenting, I got to sample project 3, probably the coolest sample project that combines several things they had learned all together. And&#8230; it was just gone.<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized">

**What Did You Do?**

I quickly searched for parts and showed a browser, then explained how the parts work. I tried to explain the major parts of the game they could build, and mentioned the code was on Github (it wasn&#8217;t there either, oops). But I at least didn&#8217;t flop around too terribly and saved myself somewhat.

**So&#8230; Where Did They Go?**

I got home and realized I must not have pushed up my latest version of the presentation after I gave it last in October 2017. I also realized I had wiped my laptop since then and so it was possibly lost. I did make a backup, so I looked in my usual backup spot. Nothing was there. Oops (again).

I searched for about an hour trying to find where this backup I _knew_ was somewhere on my home network. I did manage to find it on a hard drive in my desktop that was disconnected. Thankfully, ALL sorts of stuff was there, and I even found a second presentation I hadn&#8217;t pushed the latest changes online. (A third oops.)

I replaced the slide show online, made the updates from the Model 3B -> 3B+, removed the old hashtag I used last year, and pushed up changes. I fixed a couple of formatting issues then pushed it up again.<figure class="wp-block-image">

The page that listed everything on my website had the older projects (including one that didn&#8217;t exist anymore) so I updated those links.

**So&#8230; Why Are You Publishing a Blog Post About This?**

**Conclusion**<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">

In the end, the presentation worked out anyway, I found the latest version with all the slides and got it online, and I fixed the outdated links on my website. Now everyone can benefit from the updates. 

And I decided perhaps a post-mortem would be an interesting way to tell the story, and hopefully show other speakers that even with some disasters mid-presentation, it can turn out alright (with a bit of quick thinking) and people will still enjoy it. (And maybe having it posted online won&#8217;t be so terrible&#8230;)
