### Determining Success of Your Community {.graf.graf--h3}

<p class="graf graf--p">
  I love communities. It’s great to be around people with similar interests as you, or people who have similar issues as you. Communities really are as wide and vast as people in the world. Being a part of a community that relates to me is a wonderful thing. Finding people who have that bond with you over those common interests or feelings is amazing.
</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">
  It’s also why I always feel a bit of sadness to have to leave a community, especially one I feel such leadership to.

  Things to measure success on:
</p>

<ul class="postList">
  <li class="graf graf--li">
    <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Success is based on the focus on the members of the community, not the focus on the leaders.</em>
  </li>
  <li class="graf graf--li">
    Success is based on the friendships or connections formed.
  </li>
  <li class="graf graf--li">
    Success is based on cooperative leaders, not just individually strong leaders.
  </li>
  <li class="graf graf--li">
    Success is based on pursing a solidified and achievable mission.
  </li>
  <li class="graf graf--li">
    Success is based on standard of expectations from the members. (Code of conducts)
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="graf graf--p">
  1) Leader(s) have passion. (if the group is a craft community, the leaders should love doing cool craft projects and helping others do them)<br /> 2) Leader(s) care about group members. (The community should be about the community, so the leader really should truly care about the actual people in the group)<br /> 3) Leader(s) encourage involvement. (Community-driven groups usually seem to be better off than leader-driven ones because the community has the input as to what the group is doing)<br /> 4) Members feel welcomed and appreciated. (I’ve joined groups where no one talks to me. I don’t stay long. Or just hear “hi” and not much else. Again, communities should be about the people. Also I’ve left communities I’ve volunteered for and felt mores stressed just being there. Not worth my time and energy.)<br /> 5) Population grows or stays the same, it doesn’t shrink. (Shrinkage means enough people think stuff isn’t going right that they don’t want to invest their time. Staying the same means the members are happy. Growing means the community is doing great at bringing in more people to get more support)<br /> 6) Leader(s) shouldn’t be in it for the credit for themselves. (A book club should be about people reading books, not about the leader having a group that reads books. I realized that conferences are great when they’re ran perfectly smooth and no one has the foggiest idea who the actual organizers are. It means the focus is not on them but on the content of the conference.)
