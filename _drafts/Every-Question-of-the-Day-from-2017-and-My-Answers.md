I wrote a bit about [link] why I started asking a Question of the Day [/link]. While they haven&#8217;t been literally every day, they&#8217;ve went from a few a month to a few per week. It&#8217;s been fun to see them gain in popularity, but also to get people&#8217;s answers. (Especially if I ask a question and people interpret it in a totally different way than I expect.) All of my questions have been original ideas from me, though I&#8217;ll admit nearly all of them are inspired by some object or event or person in my life.

A few people have asked me if I have a list, or if I have answers to my questions. I haven&#8217;t, so I started a list. (And dang, it took me a while to produce this, I hope it&#8217;s worth it!)

&nbsp;

**The list of questions from 2017 (and the couple from 2018 so far):**
