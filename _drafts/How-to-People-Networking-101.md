If you&#8217;re reading this, you likely follow me on Twitter, you&#8217;ve seen me talk at a conference or even met me at one, we&#8217;ve chatted on a Slack community team, you&#8217;re a real life friend, or in some way come into contact with me. And there&#8217;s a good chance you may have noticed I generally come off as energetic, fairly positive, chatty, engaging, and so on. I&#8217;ve been described as a social butterfly, and I have a friend that describes me as extroverted and has to remind me that she&#8217;s not and needs her space and time to recover.

But I have a secret: _I&#8217;m pretty introverted too,and networking is super hard for me!_ I&#8217;ve just learned how to play the game of networking really well.

Ok, so I am still energetic and positive and all that, and I do like connecting with people. It&#8217;s taken a couple of years to figure out how to do this right. But after any sort of large event where I do a ton of &#8220;peopleing&#8221; (large amounts of interactions with others), I really do need some recuperation time.

I wanted to share some of my secrets on how I manage to mingle and network at conferences, meetups, awards events, workshops, and more, and how I&#8217;ve built up a network of people locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally.

**1) Start by understanding the** **_real_** **differences between extroversion and introversion**

I see a lot of people talk about the *-versions incorrectly, and I think understanding what they are helps you approach networking a little better.

First, these aren&#8217;t either-or scenarios. Introversion and extroversion are really a scale. No one is 100% one or the other. Or to think of it another way, everyone is a combination of both, but one is just more dominant. People who fall in the middle are ambiverts. (This is technically where I fall, though lean more on the introverted side.)

Second, this can change over time. You&#8217;re not going to stay the same forever. I went from extremely introverted in my younger years to more middle ground now. As you do more networking, or as you start to think through this post, you may find that you really do find yourself in a different spot once you overcome some of the fears of how to go about doing this. (I&#8217;ll talk about that more below.)

Third, there&#8217;s a difference between being introverted and being shy. Being shy means you&#8217;re timid or hesitant to be around people or certain situations. Being introverted means that you have more of an internal energy that&#8217;s revived by being alone. While you can be both, you don&#8217;t have to be. I used to be extremely shy, and sometimes can still be, but this is definitely independent of my ability to go into situations and interact with others now.

**2) Start to understand how your energy is used up and how your energy is restored**

This is hard to do unless you have some experience to find out how you deal with situations, but you can probably start thinking about this even without having been to many events.

Let&#8217;s try thinking through some situations:

If you&#8217;re going to hang out with one person, what is your energy level usually like? Does this vary from being with your best friend vs. being with an acquaintance you already know vs. someone you don&#8217;t know? How do you feel after you&#8217;re done being around these individual people?

If you&#8217;re going to hang out with a small group (maybe 2-8), what is your energy level like? Does this vary from being all friends you already know vs. being maybe half friends you already know vs. being one person you know vs. no one you know? How do you feel after being around a larger group of people in those combinations?

What is your energy level like with a medium group (let&#8217;s say 9-50)? What does that energy level look like if you know multiple people in the room vs. if you only know a couple vs. if you don&#8217;t know anyone? If you have to be there, do you mostly sit by yourself, or do you try to sit at a table or try to start a conversation with the person next to you? After the event is done, what would you do to recover your energy?

Finally, think about the energy level for a large group (well over 50). At this point there&#8217;s probably a significant chunk of people you don&#8217;t know. What does your energy level look like if this is a fairy quiet group (like attending a talk) vs. a more social group (like a workshop) vs. a very social group (like lunch at a conference)? Do you find yourself wanting to chat with others or wanting to pull away? When this is over, what do you need to do to recover?

**3) Before the event starts, prepare a game plan**

I find if I go into a large group of people and don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to say, I tend to want to stay away from people, or if I have to chat more, I feel sort of lost and like my brain is flopping around in my head not sure what to do. So I tend to approach situations and think through how I&#8217;m going to interact with people and base it on the situation and size.

So for example, I give a variety of software engineering conference talks. I expect that afterward people will want to talk to me. I know they will want to ask me questions, but in case they just want to meet with no real questions in mind, I want to think of several first. What&#8217;s their name, where are they from, where do they work, what kind of work do they do, did they find something particularly interesting or inspiring about my talk? Is there something that they wished I had covered, or something they thought I could improve on?

**4) Find ways to encourage interactions without being too overwhelming**

This may seem difficult at first, but there&#8217;s small subtle ways you can do this that aren&#8217;t daunting.

At events with a large number of people, you almost never have to interact with all of the room. You usually interact with a small subset. And again, not all at once. You can use this to your advantage. Treat the situation like a one-on-one situation and not like a big event, and channel your energy in that way.

If you&#8217;re in a lunch line, on an escalator, waiting in line at the restroom, or other ares where you have a person or two next to you, maybe say hi. Ask them what their favorite part of the event is. Ask them if they learned something. Ask them if they were as confused about something as you were. If you happen to know where they work, ask them about what it&#8217;s like working there. (Name tags are great for this. Go find companies you&#8217;d like to learn more about.) Ask them if they&#8217;re as excited about the lunch as you are. There&#8217;s a variety of small things you can do to test the waters. And if they&#8217;re not really receptive, then nothing really is lost there.

I know as someone who speaks at a variety of events, I love it when people have questions or want to see my demos again or how it inspires them to do something. Definitely go say hi after the talk or event. The great thing about this is you already have a topic of conversation (the talk), and to date I haven&#8217;t seen

**5) Questions are your friend, use them liberally!**

Turns out people like talking about themselves, and if you ask them questions, they&#8217;re usually pretty willing to chat. Like I mentioned above, I really like having a wealth of questions to go into situations with because it helps me talk less, it gives them something to talk about, and sounds like I&#8217;m really interested in what they have to say (which is true). It&#8217;s a win-win situation for both of us!

**6) Find ways to make the networking come to** **_you_**

You might not have thought about this, but there&#8217;s ways to make the networking come to you. It takes a bit more work up front, but can turn out to yield some great results.

First, consider speaking at an event. If there&#8217;s a meetup or conference, suggest a talk and offer to give it. Doing this means you have to prepare it, but when you deliver it, people then come up to interact with you later. They&#8217;ll have questions about your talk, and those are usually pretty easy to answer. It offers a way to have them be interested in you. I know this works as I&#8217;ve done this enough that people now approach me at conferences to meet me, even if I&#8217;m not speaking, and usually want to carry on a conversation!

Second, consider organizing an event. Ask if there&#8217;s something you can do to volunteer, which could get you into the event for free too. Ask if you could help run one of the meetings. Ask if you could suggest an alternate venue and do the connections with that. What ends up happening is you work with other people in the group/event/organization and it networks through this collaboration. You meet them, they meet you. This can have some side benefits too by letting you meet other prominent people in the community and even build up your own name too. (&#8220;Event organizer&#8221; looks nice on a resume.) Volunteering and later planning part of an event got me to meet Adam Savage from Mythbusters!

7) Get your social media going!

I had Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn for several years. They mostly sat dormant for a while. When I started using them to connect with people, they became their own networking tools. If I met someone in person, I tried to follow/connect with them. I started trying to tweet things related to my career field. I jumped on conference/event hashtags, and kept track of those hashtags and tried to like or respond to other people&#8217;s tweets. I made a rule that if someone messaged me on Twitter, I&#8217;d try to respond (unless they were a troll trying to cause trouble).

8) Use people to meet people

I&#8217;ve met a lot of people all over the country, and some from around the world. It&#8217;s kind of rare for me to land at a place where I don&#8217;t know people. But in March, it happened: I was at a conference and I knew _no one_!

Thankfully, I realized I had one mutual Twitter follower that was there. I tweeted to her to meet, and we did. From there, she introduced me to at least a dozen people. I also later ended up asking the registration desk some questions, and sat down with them and chatted for a while. I went from lonely to building up some hopeful friendships! Or at least if nothing else, networking.

If you know someone, go find the group of people they&#8217;re chatting with. Have them introduce you, and there&#8217;s a good chance the mutual acquaintance will say how they know each other or what you might have in common with the other person. Conversation starter!

If you know someone and they&#8217;re as nervous networking as you, maybe together try to find a group of people to join and go together. Strength in numbers! Introduce yourselves and say how you met and know each other. That might be a conversation starter too.

9) Learn when to gracefully accept defeat

So&#8230;&nbsp; not all networking is amazing. Sometimes you can&#8217;t find a way to connect. Sometimes they&#8217;re distracted. Sometimes you just don&#8217;t know what to say. That&#8217;s fine. Often you can kind of get a feel for that and can back away. I usually try to have an excuse on hand (&#8220;Oh there&#8217;s someone I wanted to chat with,&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m going to grab a drink,&#8221; &#8220;Time for that next talk session to start.&#8221;). This helps some with getting out easily. I try to make sure to throw in some form of &#8220;It was nice to meet you. Have a great day!&#8221; in there to end it on a good note and less awkward.
