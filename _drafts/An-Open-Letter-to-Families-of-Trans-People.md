  Dear mother, father, brother, sister, aunt, uncle, grandparent, cousin, or any other family member of someone who came out to you as transgender,
</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">
  Hi. I’m Sarah. I’ve read many letters and heard many, many responses to people who have come out to their families. There is always a wide variety of reactions from different people. I hear a lot of responses that either aren’t valid, or just don’t make any sense. I really want to address those now.
