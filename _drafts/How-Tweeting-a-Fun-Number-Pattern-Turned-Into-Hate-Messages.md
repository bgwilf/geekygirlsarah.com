      The Viral Tweet
    </h4>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      On April 8, 2016, someone on one of my Slack communities noticed that 4/8/16 (the US-based M/D/Y form of the date) would be 2²/2³/2⁴. I thought this was fun, so I tweeted it:
    </p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe"> 
    
    <div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked">
      <div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill">

      <div class="iframeContainer">
      </div>
    </div></figure> 
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      I posted it about 7:51am in my time zone. It got a few likes and retweets, then <a class="markup--user markup--p-user" href="https://medium.com/u/934eaa5944d3" target="_blank" data-href="https://medium.com/u/934eaa5944d3" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="934eaa5944d3" data-action-value="934eaa5944d3" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfoSec Taylor Swift</a> retweeted it to about 120,000 followers. Within 10 minutes of my post, it had 190 retweets. Within 45 minutes, it had 500 retweets. Before noon it was over 1000 retweets. This post went viral.

      The Responses
    </h4>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      One thing that started to happen very quickly was people pointing out that 4/8/16 wasn’t April but August, if you use the D/M/Y format, used in a larger part of the world. And because this post was getting hundreds upon hundreds of likes and retweets, of course a good percentage of them would be not from the United States. Also a good percentage would be deciding that my tweet’s date format was wrong because it’s not their format.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      The thing about opinions is that they’re right for you, but they aren’t always right in everyone else’s mind. Similarly, the thing about any standardization of anything is that a way to notate something has been decided on, and may not necessarily be how you want to do something. The idea is to stay in the same format as others so it can be easily read and mistakes in interpretation don’t happen.

      Escalation
    </h4>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      At what point did I become stupid because I posted a number pattern? If I posted it as “4, 8, 16 is 2², 2³, 2⁴,” would this have made it less “offensive?” What makes my posting this tweet, as a citizen of the US, all of a sudden wrong to the world? And as it was pointed out to me so many, many times: why couldn’t it just be reposted on August 4th for the other countries?
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      I find it amazing that simple words can have such a harsh effect. I also find it rather horrific that something intended with such innocence and fun behind it can be taken in such a cruel direction. I wonder what causes such anger and emotion from a tweet that pointed out an interesting number pattern.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      Probably the worst thing is that these last few tweets were written quickly and without thought. But read them again. “Stupid Americans.” “Retarded.” These aren’t just directed at specific people in my country, they’re pointed at <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">everyone</em> in my country. Americans aren’t always the best at things (there’s days I want to disown my country), but calling every person stupid on the basis of my tweet? Calling <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">me</em> stupid on the basis of a date format I never chose? That’s rude and discriminatory.

      The Solution?
    </h4>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      Is there a solution? People tend to just say “oh it’s just how people on the Internet are.” Or “oh someone always has to be right on the Internet.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      No. It’s an opinion. You’re entitled to yours. You can think whatever you want about the US date format or another country’s date format. You can choose to prefer M/D/Y, D/M/Y, or Y/M/D. Similarly, I’m entitled to mine too. (I prefer like Y/M/D.)
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      But at what point do we take an opinion and say “I’m more right than you, you are stupid because of it!”? I don’t think we get to. You may hate Americans, but I’m not all Americans. You may have this date format, but that’s not a reason to hate me. Or anyone. Taking a hatred of a thing or an idea and applying it to people is wrong. It’s been wrong so many times in history, and it’s this line of thinking that’s going to screw us over in the future.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      It’s social media. You get a chance to proofread what you write before you post it. Reread it. Are you hateful? Maybe delete your text and rewrite it. Or better yet, maybe not even send it at all.

      The Bright Side

    <p class="graf graf--p">
      I don’t want to end this post on an ugly note, so I want to post this on a good note.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      My friend Gabby posted this, which really made me laugh:
    </p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe"> 
    
    <div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked">
      <div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill">
      </div>
      
      <div class="iframeContainer">

    </div></figure> 
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      And it’s basically true. I normally listen to an internet radio station on my phone while I’m in the shower. And the notifications were popping up so fast that the sound lowered so much I couldn’t hear the station anymore.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      I’ve went “baby viral” before. Like 80 retweets once. Then 200 retweets later. But this… I’ve never experienced this. It was fun to feel and hear my phone buzz non stop. It was cool to see that I’ve made over 150,000 impressions today. And there were many people that had “mind = blown” tweets posted. It was great.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      Others pointed out other fun math things:

    </div></figure> 
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      But probably my favorite ones were the ones that noticed how viral, yet how nasty things were going, and tweeted some encouragement:

    <p class="graf graf--p">
      Take this as a final thought: there’s nothing gained from bringing me down for something I have no control over. Instead, maybe find something uplifting to say. “It’s 8/4/16 to me, but that’s some cool math anyway!” is a lot better than those ugly tweets above. Take a few seconds to take the ugly out of your language. You can brighten someone’s day instead.
