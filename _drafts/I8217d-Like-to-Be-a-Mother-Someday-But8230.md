Hi. I have a confession to make. I’m not a mother. In fact, I used to HATE kids. I had NO intention of ever being a parent. Kids are annoying and gross and noisy and slimey and so much work and…  ugh!  They did NOT appeal to me at ALL!

&nbsp;

But then…  something happened. Somehow that motherly instinct switch flipped on. And all of a sudden…  kids are cute. And adorable. And sure, still slimey and gross, but… I don’t know. I kind of wanted a kid. I wanted to be a mom someday.

&nbsp;

But becoming a mother is… difficult. And to explain why, I have to fill you in on some of my background story.

&nbsp;

For most of my life I’ve been depressed. Confused. Things about my life didn’t make a lot of sense. After many years of thought and research and discovery, I learned that I am transgender. You’ve probably heard the term a lot in the news lately. The basic nutshell is that for most people, the gender that they feel they are in their mind matches up with the sex of their body. And for me… it doesn’t. I very much have the mentality of a woman. My body just doesn’t entirely match. But in 2007, at the age of 24, I started the process of taking hormones to start to fix things.

&nbsp;

Do any of you there remember puberty? That awkward time of your life when it felt like everything about your body changed? I obviously went through this as a teen. I then got to do it again at 24. I call it “Puberty 2.0.” Slowly, these hormones helped the confusion and depression started to lift out of my mind. I started to like my life. I started to like myself. I started to feel like I had more purpose. In addition, my body started changing. All the weird pains and sensitivity and awkward situations from the first puberty came back for the second one. Despite that, life was getting better for me, and I was becoming happy with it.

&nbsp;

Then, about 6 months in the process…  IT happened. I was out at a restaurant, and I heard a kid cry. And I looked over. I felt sad for the kid. I wondered what was wrong. I wanted to hold it. I wanted to comfort it.

&nbsp;

_Oh crap._ Somewhere the hatred of kids disappeared. I grew a motherly instinct. Now, not only do I want children, but I’ve had many people tell me I’m wonderful around them. I have fun holding and playing with them. Something changed in me, and perhaps that’s not a bad thing.

&nbsp;

But I couldn’t help but wonder that if I did have children, what would happen. Would they end up as mixed up and confused and screwed up like I felt I was? Would they end up depressed or suicidal like I was? Would they be as confused about their gender as I was? I didn’t want to subject any child to any of these tortures, so that helped make the decision to not ever have children.  But perhaps adopting would be fine. Maybe bringing a kid into my life without my genetics would be better. They could have a good home, I could still be that family that they need.

&nbsp;

To add more complication to the story, my parents disowned me about 9 years ago. They didn’t agree with my “lifestyle change,” as some would call it. To anyone that has known me for a while though, they can see a world of difference in my old self and current self. I’m better now, happy, successful. Still, it is a bit of a shame that my parents have decided that instead of having a happier (but slightly less “normal”) child, they would rather just have nothing to do with me. This has made me wonder: if I adopt children, what would they ultimately think? I shouldn’t hide my history from them, no matter how my life has evolved. If I came out, would they want to disown me? Would they freak out upon hearing this? Would they be angry at me for hiding it? Would their thoughts of me change so that they couldn’t ever see me as a proper mother again?

&nbsp;

Another difficulty is my own internal struggles. It took most my whole life for me to finally admit that I’m a woman. Will I be able to call myself a mother? Is someone not born with a female reproductive system allowed to call themselves that? Will I ever be able to be in a relationship with a man that would be able to see past that and still love me for me, and also be ok with adopting a child instead? Would I have to be a single mom on my own?

&nbsp;

The concept of a family is a bit confusing in my mind due to my past experiences. But the more time goes on, the more I learn about myself, the more I become comfortable in my body. The idea of being a mother feels more right. Now is NOT the right time in my life to have a kid. But maybe in a couple more years, I could adopt a child. And maybe that child would love that they will have a mom that cares that they exist. And maybe they can appreciate that I will love them as they are, no matter how they turn out. And maybe they won’t be angry at me if I come out to them.

&nbsp;

And maybe, hopefully, becoming a mother someday won’t be as difficult and confusing as I _used_ to think it would be.
