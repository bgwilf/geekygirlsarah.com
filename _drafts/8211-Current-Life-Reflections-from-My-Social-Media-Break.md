I needed to take a break from social media. These are the reflections on why, and what came from that break.

First, it started off by knowing I needed to keep thinking through a few things about my life. I&#8217;ve been going through this life reboot (if you will) and starting a new job and relocating to a new city did wonders for this. But there&#8217;s still been some lingering thoughts.

Second, within about the period of a week, I had many people snap at me, either from stressful situations or something I did, or maybe even something that had no involvement with me. But it made me want to just back away from it all for a while. So for about the last two months, I&#8217;ve had very minimal interactions with social media. Conversations have been with friends in real life or directly over text, email, or phone, and it&#8217;s been kind of nice. I think leaving the distractions of social media has been nice, even though I do kind of miss some of those interactions.

So now I&#8217;ve finally had some time to stop and think. This post is sort of the brain dump of that. I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ll post it, and I don&#8217;t expect it to be a permanently complete document, but I want to at least get something down.

(I feel like I should add in that there&#8217;s times where I feel like I&#8217;m bragging. I&#8217;m not one who generally toots their own horn, but I want to try to embrace things I realize I&#8217;m good at, so I&#8217;m going to talk about it in a way that I feel reflects in my head not to brag but to just say &#8220;I think this is a thing in my life.&#8221;)

So&#8230; here we go&#8230;

## Mission

It&#8217;s weird to feel successful at things I do, yet, super unsuccessful at other things, yet also feel like there&#8217;s no good direction to my life. I keep getting vibes and hints that I really should have a direction to what I&#8217;m doing, so this is a dump of that.

If I was to have a mission statement for life, I think I want it to be something like &#8220;I want to be an intelligent, thoughtful, caring, creative, and beautiful person in everything that I possible do.&#8221;

Intelligent: Once upon a time, I was a really smart kid. Then I feel like I lost all that through the worst depression years. When I felt it come back, I went back to college and made a career for myself. I know now that my brain is very smart. I also feel like I haven&#8217;t had many opportunities to let this part of me thrive a ton, which is at minimum why I knew I needed a new job and possibly other things too. I want to put my brain back to work and keep having it come up with great things.

Thoughtful: I&#8217;ve learned that I have a type of mind that absorbs some things, takes some time to think it through, then takes some action. The more I try to do things without much thought or reflection, the worse I think it turns out. I think this could include things like debates with people, difficult situations I land in, making sure I&#8217;m inclusive in my language, to be as least offensive as I can be, and so on. I think this has helped me become a person people like to be a round, a person people trust, and a person people tend to relate to, and I think it&#8217;s more important that I keep trying to learn how to be better at this.

Caring: I think I am a rather caring person naturally, but it&#8217;s not always easy to be caring in every situation you can be in. It&#8217;s easy to want to put yourself first. I find also it&#8217;s hard to be as caring when I find myself on-guard or defensive about something. Also whenever my mind goes into more of a depressive hole, it&#8217;s harder to focus on others still. I want to try to make sure I remain a caring person, partly because I think it makes me a better person in general, but also because I think it makes other people&#8217;s lives better in small ways as well.

Creative: I used to not really think of myself as a creative person. I still kind of don&#8217;t. But I&#8217;ve learned through some interesting job challenges, through getting involved in choirs and music, through starting a few side hobbies, that really all of these are creative in their own ways. I think intelligence and creativity are very closely tied together too. The more time goes on, the more I&#8217;m learning about myself and the more I&#8217;m trying to take myself away from the purely scientific/logical/technical stuff and try to dive into areas I&#8217;m not as used to. I feel I&#8217;ve been more enlightened as I&#8217;ve started diving into these areas the past few years, and I really want to try to do it more.

Beautiful: This is probably the hardest for me. I&#8217;ve never thought of myself beautiful, but the past few years I&#8217;ve gotten better about it. I see beautiful, for me at least, as the combination of an internal and external component. I think one can be pretty on the outside but ugly on the inside, and vice versa. I&#8217;ve struggled with both over the years. I&#8217;m getting better at trying to embrace this. while I don&#8217;t know that this is a thing I can outwardly show as easily, I think the more I embrace this idea in my head, and accept that I am capable of being beautiful, and quite possibly actually am presently beautiful, the more it will help the other pieces.

Is this everything? I don&#8217;t know. But I kind of feel like all of the different things I kept thinking of fell into one of these 5 categories, and now and in the future I want to focus on them all.

I see this mission statement playing out a lot in my life a lot. Or at least want it to.

### Friendships/Relationships

I think about my friendships. I&#8217;ve had a lot of wonderful and amazing people in my life over the years. Sometimes they&#8217;ve stuck around through thick and thin (Beth and Kurt for > 14 years, Susan for 11, Abbey for 7, etc.) and some others have wandered in and out for a while, while others have just kind of popped in as acquaintances. I do appareciate the people in my life, but know over the past year or two there&#8217;s been a lot of rough times and I haven&#8217;t treated people in my life as well as I should have. I really want to fix this. I don&#8217;t want people to think of me as someone they should avoid because they have issues, or doesn&#8217;t have their head on straight, or anything like that. I also hope my friends feel they can be honest with me about things they think, whether positive or negative, as I do want to incorporate them into becoming a better person.

There are other people I occasionally think about. People I run into every so often. I may not be friends with them but they do have some relationship with my life (and in some cases, whether I really want them there or not). While I have that personality that wants to please everyone, I am coming to accept I can&#8217;t please everyone, and I just won&#8217;t click with some people. I do still want to be someone that can be respected even if we don&#8217;t get along. Especially if I keep running into them in assorted ways.

Relocating to another city has its effects on relationships. The people I considered my best friends now life hundreds of miles away. One still talks to me at least once a week, one at least once a month, though there&#8217;s one that I think I&#8217;ve heard from twice since getting here. And while I&#8217;ve met a bunch of new people, I don&#8217;t know that any have been heading towards the same level of BFFness as I left behind. I do occasionally have feelings of being lonely, despite knowing several people even before I got here. I just think about this every so often.

I also think about how my friends seem to come in phases, and I&#8217;m not sure why. As things change in life, I tend to just lose friends, mostly just from their life changes or something happening. (Like getting done with school, not being in certain communities anymore, them getting partners, getting married, or having kids.) It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m hoping that maybe settling in a place where my life isn&#8217;t changing dramatically every couple of years might fix this some.

I also think about more romatic relationships. 

### Career

It&#8217;s weird to think my whole life I&#8217;ve wanted to be in software. And I still do. I find it fascinating still to do this day, and it&#8217;s still super easy to side track me with articles on new tech, cool ways of doing software, and saying &#8220;Hey Sarah, can you help me figure this out?&#8221; But some things have changed over time.

For one, I always thought I just wanted to program. And I do and still love it. But as time goes on, the more I&#8217;m finding I think other aspects besides code are important and interesting too. Thinking through software in a big picture/architecture way engages my brain in the same way that coding always seemed to. I also find that programming for programming sake doesn&#8217;t work for me. I really like the problem solving, and I really find it benefits me to know that ultimately my software is helping people and it&#8217;s doing good somehow. 

I&#8217;ve heard a lot of people say a lot lately about how you&#8217;re supposed to build up your career in a certain way. You&#8217;re supposed to become an expert. Being a generalist won&#8217;t get you the success that you&#8217;d find being an expert. I struggle some with this. Partly because it&#8217;s been rather helpful to be a generalist, especially as jobs up to this point have all been all over the place. Also partly because my present job hired me literally to be a generalist, and I&#8217;ve acquired a variety of skills in 6 months just from being thrown into random things constantly. It&#8217;s been kind of fun, though kind of stressful as well.

I think I&#8217;m finding that, while the new job in the new city has been REALLY good to me, I&#8217;m still kind of in a lull. I think there&#8217;s something to be said that I&#8217;m not fully reset yet. And I&#8217;m not 100% certain how. I think for one thing, I need a vacation. This has always been a struggle for me. Talking myself into doing it, into taking the time off and spending the money, into saying it&#8217;s an important thing I need to do for my mental health, it&#8217;s just been hard. And I think I&#8217;m finally at a place to knowing I need to do this. My present workplace&#8217;s unlimited PTO should make this easier, in theory. Also the larger salary should make this easier, in theory. Also the very smart and supportive manager should make this easier. I need to take the time to reset myself.

For my future? I don&#8217;t know. I see myself climbing the developer ladder, but not really the management ladder or the analyst ladder or anything. But when I&#8217;m not a specialized in anything, I do wonder how this can happen. One of the pros seems to be that I haven&#8217;t seen really many labels on people at work outside of &#8220;software engineer&#8221;, meaning there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a lot of ranks. So the coworker in the field for 20 years has the same title as me, as does the coworker that&#8217;s been in the field for 1. This feels good, but also feels weird when I see friends get their promotions and move up their ladders too.

Past this&#8230;&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know. I probably need to talk to my manager (who also happens to be someone that&#8217;s regularly involved in community things, and has become a bit of a friend too) and maybe just see what he thinks about my future, about where I want to go in my career. I think he&#8217;d have some insightful things to say. (Where as one of the more recent conference talks of navigating your career just dripped of luck and privilege, and just made me feel uneasy that this person talked like these things were just plain easy and natural.) 

### Social Media

I have watched how social media and I evolved together over the years. It started off on MySpace and Facebook with just friends and LiveJournal with assorted communities and I was mostly closed in. Now I&#8217;ve evolved into mostly Twitter and Slack and are very open and public with them. The types of people I interact with mostly have changed too, starting off with real life friends and morphing into the vast majority of people I chat with on a regular basis are people that don&#8217;t live anywhere near me.

I realize that &#8220;geekygirlsarah&#8221; has evolved into a brand of sorts. I didn&#8217;t start out planning to do this, but it has been a conscious thought of mine for a few years. As I started going to conferences, started to get really involved in activities in college, started to be involved in local communities, and eventually speaking at conferences, I&#8217;ve watched my interactions with social media change. I made a decision towards the end of college and when I started public speaking that I was going to make social media public, and also by doing so, I&#8217;d probably have to make sure I filtered and was thoughtful about what I posted. For the most part, I think this has worked.

I&#8217;ve been told by many people that they love interacting with me on Twitter and Slack, and really like how I&#8217;m positive, encouraging, supportive, and funny. They also like how my tweets tend to help break up the trash and anger that&#8217;s on so many other feeds. But there&#8217;s also been some interactions within the past 6 months that have made me question what people think about me, and if I really am maintaining an image that I want to maintain. (This wasn&#8217;t as big of a deal with a few hundred followers, but with several thousand, stuff I tweet gets noticed a LOT more.)

I don&#8217;t want to sound like a marketing promotion or a self-help book when I talk about maintaining a brand. Because really my &#8220;brand&#8221; is just me&#8230; I want my online presence to reflect how I see myself. And I want my interactions to reflect how I want to see myself too. While I&#8217;ve been conscious of what I posted in the past, I think I want to try to focus on my conversations (either short posts or longer form) and make sure they stay true to what I want to be: intelligent, thoughtful, caring, creative, and beautiful.
