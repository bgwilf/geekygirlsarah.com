  * [Space] [Has Dogma Derailed the Search for Dark Matter](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2017/02/06/dogma-derailed-search-dark-matter/) talks a bit about Pavel Kroupa&#8217;s research group, and how they keep showing that time and time again, taking dark matter out of their equations shows a more accurate universe in their models compared to how it looks in real life, but because the idea of dark matter is SO mainstream, they lose out on funding and are a bit of the laughing stock of the astrophysics community. It&#8217;s interesting both on science and on the effects of how we still have to battle truth vs. preexisting knowledge that might not be right.
  * [Science] In an article about [bumblebees learning to play soccer](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2017/02/23/bumblebees-learn-to-play-soccer/), it goes quickly from &#8220;why are scientists doing _that_??&#8221; to &#8220;wow, that&#8217;s pretty amazing!&#8221; really fast. It fascinates me that not onlyÂ  have scientists taught them basic skills, but they&#8217;re teaching other bumblebees to do it, AND all the training is generalized, so variables can change and they still know what they&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s really incredible to me.
