  I LOVE Twitter. It’s been my favorite social media platform for about a year. However, I’ve had several friends that say they just don’t understand Twitter, or it’s too overwhelming for them. I don’t blame them. I didn’t use it for several years because of that.

  Once I found a good way to organize the chaos, it’s become a great platform to not only share thoughts, but support others, network with people, and learn about what’s going on in the world as well as my friends’ lives. And I would like to share how I did that.
