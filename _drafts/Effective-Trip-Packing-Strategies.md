I&#8217;ve been going on more and more road trips and flights in the past couple of years (probably more in the past 18 months than the rest of my life). I&#8217;ve had several people notice that my packing skills are rather efficient and have asked me about them. And this past weekend a friend who hasn&#8217;t flown in 20 years asked for advice on how to survive the trip. So I figured I&#8217;d mention all this in a blog post!

I&#8217;ll start off talking about what to pack to help you not forget anything, but then switch over to different ways to pack to be more efficient. I&#8217;ll also talk about how to best prepare to be efficient at airports and the security mess you have to go through.

Let&#8217;s get packing!

**What to Pack**

Let&#8217;s start with the basics: what to bring with you. I know there&#8217;s a lot of things you could take, and if you&#8217;re like me, the first instinct is to grab about everything you use on a daily basis. But I want to help narrow it down a bit. (And obviously you may not need all of this.)

  * Clothes: My rule is one outfit for the number of days you&#8217;re gone plus one. So if you&#8217;re gone for three days, bring four outfits. &#8220;But why??&#8221; Good question. Because _something_ will inevitably happen to one of your outfits if you don&#8217;t have a backup.
  * Account for weather: Also choose clothes to account for the weather. Remember there&#8217;s some form of weather from where you&#8217;re departing from and arriving back to, as well as the full amount of time you&#8217;ll be gone. Don&#8217;t forget jackets or coats! (This may seem obvious, but I have packed for trips assuming a particular set of weather and worn some drastically wrong stuff. Like raining the day I show up back home, or snow at the place I went to.)
  * Shoes: I recommend as few shoes as possible. To make it easier, try to pick different _types_ of shoes as opposed to different _colors_ of shoes. So a pair of flats, tennis shoes, and heels will probably help you out more than 3 pairs of flats. (Unless you really can go the whole trip with just that one type.)
  * Underwear: My rule here is about the same as for clothes: One pair per day plus one.
  * Toiletries: If you need them, feel free to grab them. With checked luggage you can just grab full bottles. For carry-ons, you need to follow the 3 fl. oz. bottle rule (so no more than 3 fl. oz. of a liquid, and no more than can fit in a 1 quart bag). Typically I just use hotel shampoos and conditioners but if you&#8217;re not staying in a hotel, this may be something to consider
  * Personal care: Any sort of lotions, face cleansers, deodorant, and such like that. These usually _aren&#8217;t_ provided by hotels, so they&#8217;ll be handy to have.
  * Hair care: Brushes, combs, hair ties, hairspray, etc. Whatever you normally use.
  * Make-up: If you wear it, you may want to pack it. It may also have to meet the TSA bottle rule if it&#8217;s liquid. I&#8217;d also narrow down what you will _actually_ wear and not have too much otherwise. (It&#8217;s just more to mess with and repack later.)
  * Accessories: Don&#8217;t forget to throw in anything you like to add to your outfits.
  * Medicines: This is definitely important. Take enough to get you buy, but I&#8217;d probably recommend at least an extra day&#8217;s worth. (Never know if you&#8217;ll drop a pill and it rolls away or if you break a bottle of some sort.)
  * Walking attire: If you&#8217;re doing a ton of walking, make sure you have appropriate shoes, sunscreen, hats, or anything else for sun protection or to make it easier on your body.
  * Electronics: Laptops and tablets are common things, but don&#8217;t forget your chargers! And that they&#8217;re charged before you board the plane if you plan to use them.
  * Plane entertainment: Grab those books, crosswords, sudokus, music players or phones with downloaded music on them, earphones, etc. Hours on a plane are rather boring.
  * Car entertainment: If you&#8217;re driving&#8230; well, no books or anything, but phones do loose connectivity, so make sure streaming players have some offline music downloaded.
  * Travel apps: If you want to install apps for AAA, your airline, or nearest fuel station, now&#8217;s the time to do it.
  * Identification: Last but not least, make sure you know where your driver&#8217;s license or passport or other identifying material is.

**How to Pack**

First, I always try to assume at least two hours for this. The actual act of packing isn&#8217;t that long, but I dwell a lot on what outfits to bring and whether I&#8217;m taking too much with me and all that. And just general procrastination.
