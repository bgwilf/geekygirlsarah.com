I HATE my birthday.

Ok, so hate is a strong word. But the feelings I have around the day are quite strong. It’s been hard to explain to people that this day that is supposed to be special and happy doesn’t feel special and I’m usually anything but happy. I quit telling people when it was because I wanted the day to just feel like a normal day with no fake fluff of wishes or anything like that. But I’m conflicted this year. Let me explain.

I’ve dealt with the monster called Depression for a long time. Years. Most of my life that I can remember. I’ve had a general hatred for my life and for myself. For many years, the birthday was a reminder of this. I was another year older, and I hadn’t accomplished anything with my life. My friends had careers or families or at least seemed to have a direction to their lives. I had Depression, and this lack of feeling any sort of accomplishment. So on the birthday, I felt older, and a general sadness to my life. I often cried. I often was angry. I sometimes would scream into my pillow.

Drama didn’t help. Between my birthday, my sister’s birthday, Christmas, and my aunt’s and cousin’s birthdays all in a row (all within 3 weeks), it was always a mess. And growing up there were always arguments and yelling and such. I liked the birthday when I was young, but the more time went on the more I kind of wished I could hide for all of the holidays. My mother was at least ten times more excited than I ever was.

Several years ago, I started the process of [fighting my depression and finally becoming who I was supposed to be](https://medium.com/the-lighthouse/life-gender-and-the-pursuit-of-happiness-e0e57970ceae). Life got better. It didn’t get easy, but I enjoyed it more. The birthday though… it still lingered. It was odd to start to appreciate myself and my life, but still have a hatred for the birthday. Mostly, it still felt like I didn’t have a career doing what I wanted and no college degree and some other things that plagued my mind. I still felt I had no reason to celebrate.

I met my wonderful friend Susan many years ago. She shared with me about her son Mark, who died in a drunk driving accident on the birthday. I would have been 8 at the time. It’s hard knowing that one of the dearest people in my life lost her son on that day. From that came a tradition that she and I go out on the day every year. It’s a rough day, but being there for each other has helped.

Then something else happened. The homeless food kitchen organization Susan and I volunteered with had a director named Doug who went into the hospital at the beginning of the month, but passed away on the birthday a couple of years ago.

The day got a bit more rough as this reminder of so many bad things that had happened, as well as the depression and drama, and it all culminated around the birthday.

2015 was a different year. I accomplished things. I filled an entire page in a word processor with all of the things I recall achieving this year. Some of the top ones include:

  * I went back to school (after dropping out for 6 years) and walked at my graduation
  * I gave 4 conference talks, 2 meetup talks, and helped organize 2 conferences
  * I taught an intro to programming (C++) course at a university
  * I started my first career job
  * I won an award at that job in less than 6 months
  * I started a new “teach girls to code” after school group at a local underprivileged high school, as well as mentored a variety of other middle and high school groups in programming and robotics
  * I wrote a coming out post that’s been read nearly 4,000 times. Oh, and I came out to the public.
  * I helped organize a new podcast and was a guest on the first episode and I am hosting the second
  * I contributed my time and programming skills to other software projects for the first time. (For the technical people: I made my first pull requests on GitHub and had them accepted.)
  * … and more

I used to hate the birthday because my life wasn’t successful and I felt like I wasn’t getting anywhere. But that changed. I did SO many things that I never would have dreamed I was capable of doing. And the list of great things isn’t slowing down. I am very much becoming successful.

With that, I can’t help but think about the birthday. The day that’s supposed to be special. The day that I was born. Also the day that for so many years I wished I wasn’t. The day that most people seem to accept and celebrate, but the it’s day that I quit telling people when it is. And I need to reclaim it.

I am glad I’m here and I’m alive. I’m glad I’ve finally accomplished goals I’ve had (graduation and being a software developer), as well as so much more. I’m glad that I have good friends in my city, state, country, and even world, and they appreciate and love me just as much as I do them. I’m glad that I’m able to affect my communities for the better, and have so many more opportunities to do it. I’m glad I’m starting to see myself as someone who is intelligent, pretty, confident, beautiful, and worthy of nice things in my life. I still periodically fight depression, but I’m glad I’m me.

And with that, I want to reclaim this birthday. I want to say “It’s mine, and I’m wonderful.” I don’t want birthday wishes from people (they feel fake). I don’t want presents (I actually get awful guilty feelings from them). I don’t want parties or anything like that. I do want to not feel awful on the day. I want to be around the special people in my life (I prefer presence over presents). I want to show them that they are important to me. I am not ready to celebrate the birthday, but I am ready to try to appreciate it.

And with all of that said, my birthday this year is Wednesday, December 16th. I will be 33. I **don’t** want birthday wishes, presents, parties, cake, or anything else. I just want to take the day in and try to appreciate it. Here’s hoping it will be the first actual happy and peaceful birthday I’ve had for many, many years.
