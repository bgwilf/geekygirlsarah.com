Title Ideas:

  * Myths and Misconceptions about Mental Health
  * 

&nbsp;

Assorted ideas:

&nbsp;

  * Mental health as a really hard problem. I started working towards a conf talk on myths behind mental health in tech, and really could take my ideas and change them around a bit to talk about this. Besides users being hard problems, I think us as people in tech also are hard problems. How do we work productively when we&#8217;re preoccupied or stressed or anxious? How do we keep moving forward with so much impostor syndrome and such? How can we build more supportive teams? I think these are great questions that can be answered, as well as provide resources to help people out.
  * One thing I’d really like to include, because I don’t see it addressed elsewhere, is that we all start from different points in terms of our mental health and neuro(a)typicality. Someone who comes into the industry with depression or PTSD or ADHD will have a different experience than someone who doesn’t. I also think we forget to talk about more severe illnesses like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and dissociative disorders, even though there are certainly people in the industry who have these conditions.
  * Mental health is a constant state, like physical health. Mental health alone doesn’t mean “depressed” or anything else. (Those are “mental health issues”)
  * We use our brains in the tech industry, so we need to keep our brains working well to keep being good at our jobs
  * People obviously need to control their own mental health, but the ideal team would support each team member’s health
  * Self care + mental health and it’s important. (“self care” isn’t just a fluffy word)
  * The rate of burnout and suicide and other bad things in tech is extremely high
