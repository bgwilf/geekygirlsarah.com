      I’ve seen a lot of people talk about how to apply and prepare their first conference talk. (See _, _, _, _, and _.) But… I often get asked for suggestions on what to do for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">giving</em> that first talk.

      get your talk done early, give it to friends (real life or skype/hangout). Get constructive feedback. (not just feedback). Rewrite. Try to give it again. revise again.

      [10:38]<br /> then day of, I’d take off the session before yours. try any relaxation thing you can think of. some I’ve heard from people:
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      [10:40]<br /> &#8211; Listen to high energy, upbeat music before going out<br /> &#8211; Sit in a quiet space before starting and close your eyes and relax. (Set a phone alarm so you get back up on time)<br /> &#8211; Mouth out your slides one more time before going. Make sure you space out your sentences so you’re not rushed.<br /> &#8211; I usually do a confidence boosting walk to my room. Leave stuff in speaker room, grab computer and anything you need (clicker, mouse, whatever), and just hold onto that and walk with good posture and affirmative steps to the room, walk up front, and set up.
