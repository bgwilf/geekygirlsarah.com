## Abstract/Description

Secrets can be scary if they get out. That’s the very feeling I had when I wrote a Medium post revealing my biggest 
secret, which was read by thousands. In this talk, I will share the story of how and why I came to share this secret 
with the world. I’ll also talk about how sharing this ultimately made me a better teammate, developer, and person, and 
how it had the complete opposite reaction than I expected. Through these experiences, I’ll share my insights on why 
being more open benefits you and your team.

## Talk Outline
