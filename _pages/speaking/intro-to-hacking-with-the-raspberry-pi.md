## Abstract/Description

You've heard lots of hype about the Raspberry Pi, the credit-card sized computer available for under $40. This talk 
will introduce some of the Pi's features, explore some sample projects you can create, and show you how to write code 
to control hardware through its IO pins. After this talk you will be ready to make your own cool hacking projects with 
the Pi.
