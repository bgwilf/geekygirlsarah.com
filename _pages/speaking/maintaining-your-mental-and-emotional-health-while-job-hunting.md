## Abstract/Description

Searching for a new job. We all have to do it at some point. In the thick of the search, you’re likely to get a lot of 
terrible tech interviews as well as a bunch of rejections. How do you maintain your energy, your motivation, and 
perhaps more importantly, not feel like a failure after all that?

I will talk a bit about my most recent job search. You’ll see how I went into it with a different frame of mind than I 
had in the past, and how that helped me push through the interviews easier and take better care of myself in the 
process. You’ll also hear about some of the specific interviews and the problems I saw with them. I’ll show how, as 
companies and teams, we can improve the process for everyone. Finally, I’ll offer ways that both companies and 
employees can offer feedback to continue to improve interviews.
