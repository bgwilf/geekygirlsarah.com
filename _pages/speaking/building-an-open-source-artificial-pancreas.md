## Abstract/Description

Have you ever thought about what open source software or hardware could achieve? What if it could help improve people's 
lives by solving some of their health problems?

After the medical tech industry kept promising a system to help automatically manage insulin for type 1 diabetic people 
and never delivering, some people got together to find ways to do it with the tech they already had. Over the past few 
years, a "closed-loop" system has been developed to algorithmically regulate people's insulin levels. After reverse 
engineering bluetooth sensors and 915 MHz insulin pumps, the system became possible. As a diabetic, I also built this 
system and saw my sugar values stabilize much more than I could ever achieve doing it manually myself. Now I'm working 
on contributing back to the projects as well.

I want to talk about this system, from a technical side as well as a personal side. You'll learn about OpenAPS (the 
open artificial pancreas system) and how it works, what problems it solves, and its safety and security concerns. 
You'll see how the system has helped me and what this means for my health now and in the future. Ultimately, you'll see 
how we, as software developers, can change people's lives through the code we write.
