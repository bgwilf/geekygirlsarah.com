Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth.

If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Here we're limited by the time we have. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here.

It all happens automatically. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. It is a lot of fun. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends.

That's a son of a gun of a cloud. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. We don't have anything but happy trees here.

There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Work that paint. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it.

A beautiful little sunset. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. You can do anything your heart can imagine. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things?

Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will.
